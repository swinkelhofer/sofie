# SoFiE - The Socat Fileserver Experiments

[![Release](https://github.com/swinkelhofer/sofie/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/swinkelhofer/sofie/actions/workflows/release.yml)

A minimal fileserver based on the swiss-army-knife-tool Socat - completely written in Bash.
The goal of SoFiE was to minimize dependencies to only a subset that (almost) any Linux distro is shipping.

Et voil√†, without further need to explain, here we go:
